# bt-permission-tester

Sample app for testing Android 12 Bluetooth permissions. This demonstrates that an app compiling against SDK 30 or higher, but targeting SDK 29 or lower does not have the Bluetooth permissions automatically granted through compatibility mode. The user must grant the permission manually via OS settings.
